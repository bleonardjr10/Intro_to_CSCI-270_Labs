Write a program that takes in a positive integer as input, and outputs a string of 1's and 0's representing the integer in reverse binary. For an integer x, the algorithm is:

As long as x is greater than 0
   Output x modulo 2 (remainder is either 0 or 1)
   Assign x with x divided by 2
Note: The above algorithm outputs the 0's and 1's in reverse order.

Ex: If the input is:
6

the output is:
011

6 in binary is 110; the algorithm outputs the bits in reverse.


### TYPE YOUR CODE HERE

user_input = int(input())

def reverse_binary(user_input):
    result = ''
    while user_input > 0:
        result += str(user_input % 2)
        user_input = user_input // 2
    return result

print(reverse_binary(user_input))
