# Write a program whose inputs are three integers, and whose output is the smallest of the three values.
#
# Ex: If the input is:
# 7
# 15
# 3
#
# the output is:
# 3

### TYPE YOUR CODE HERE
number1 = int(input())
number2 = int(input())
number3 = int(input())

if number1 <= number2 and number1 <= number3:
    print(number1)
elif number2 <= number1 and number2 <= number3:
    print(number2)
elif number3 <= number1 and number3 <= number2:
    print(number3)
