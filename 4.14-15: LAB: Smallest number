Write a program whose inputs are three integers, and whose output is the smallest of the three values.

Ex: If the input is:
7
15
3

the output is:
3

### TYPE YOUR CODE HERE

number1 = int(input())
number2 = int(input())
number3 = int(input())

if number1 <= number2 and number1 <= number3:
    print(number1)
elif number2 <= number1 and number2 <= number3:
    print(number2)
elif number3 <= number1 and number3 <= number2:
    print(number3)
