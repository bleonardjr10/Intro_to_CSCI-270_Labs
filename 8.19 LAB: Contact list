A contact list is a place where you can store a specific contact with other associated information such as a phone number, 
email address, birthday, etc. Write a program that first takes in word pairs that consist of a name and a phone number 
(both strings), separated by a comma. That list is followed by a name, and your program should output the phone number 
associated with that name. Assume the search name is always in the list.

Ex: If the input is:
Joe,123-5432 Linda,983-4123 Frank,867-5309
Frank

the output is:
867-5309

contacts_input = input().split()

contacts = {contact.split(',')[0]: contact.split(',')[1] for contact in contacts_input}

contacts_input = input().split()
contacts = {}

for contact in contacts_input:
    name, number = contact.split(',')
    contacts[name] = number
