A pedometer treats walking 1 step as walking 2.5 feet. Define a function named feet_to_steps that takes a float as a parameter, 
representing the number of feet walked, and returns the number of steps walked as an integer by using int(). Then, write a 
main program that reads the number of feet walked as an input, calls function feet_to_steps() with the input as an argument, 
and outputs the number of steps returned from feet_to_steps().

Use floating-point arithmetic to perform the conversion.

Note: Converting a float to an integer may affect the result's accuracy.

Ex: If the input is:
150.5

the output is:
60

The program must define and call the following function:
def feet_to_steps(user_feet)

### TYPE YOUR CODE HERE

def feet_to_steps(num_feet):
    return int(num_feet / 2.5)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_feet = float(input())
    
    num_steps = feet_to_steps(num_feet)
    print(num_steps)
