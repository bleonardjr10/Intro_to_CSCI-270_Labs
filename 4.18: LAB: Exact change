# Write a program with total change amount as an integer input, and output the
# change using the fewest coins, one coin type per line. The coin types are Dollars,
# Quarters, Dimes, Nickels, and Pennies. Use singular and plural coin names as appropriate,
# like 1 Penny vs. 2 Pennies.
#
# Ex: If the input is:
# 0
#
# (or less than 0), the output is:
# No change
#
# Ex: If the input is:
# 45
#
# the output is:
# 1 Quarter
# 2 Dimes
