Write a program whose input is two integers. Output the first integer and subsequent increments of 5 as long as the value is less than or equal to the second integer.

Ex: If the input is:

-15
10
the output is:

-15 -10 -5 0 5 10 
Ex: If the second integer is less than the first as in:

20
5
the output is:

Second integer can't be less than the first.
For coding simplicity, output a space after every integer, including the last. End the output with a newline.


### TYPE YOUR CODE HERE

user_1 = int(input())
user_2 = int(input())

if user_1 > user_2:
    print("Second integer can't be less than the first.")
else:
    for num in range(user_1, user_2 + 1, 5):
        print(num, end=' ')
    print()
