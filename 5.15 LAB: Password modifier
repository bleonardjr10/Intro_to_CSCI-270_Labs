#Many user-created passwords are simple and easy to guess. Write a program that takes a simple password and makes it stronger by replacing characters using the key below, and by appending "!" to the end of the input string.
#
#i becomes 1
#a becomes @
#m becomes M
#B becomes 8
#s becomes $
#Ex: If the input is:
#
#mypassword
#the output is:
#
#Myp@$$word!
#Hint: Python strings are immutable, but support string concatenation. Store and build the stronger password in the given password variable.


###TYPE YOUR CODE HERE
word = input()

for char in word:
    if char == 'i':
        password += '1'
    elif char == 'a':

    elif char == 'm':
        password += 'M'
    elif char == 'B':
