Statistics are often calculated with varying amounts of input data. Write a program that takes any number of non-negative 
floating-point numbers as input, and outputs the max and average, respectively.

Output the max and average with two digits after the decimal point.

Ex: If the input is:
14.25 25 0 5.75

the output is:
25.00 11.25


### TYPE YOUR CODE HERE

numbers = list(map(float, input().split()))

max_value = max(numbers)
average_value = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

print(f' {max_value:.2f} {average_value:.2f}')
