Write a program whose input is a string which contains a character and a phrase, and whose output indicates the number of 
times the character appears in the phrase. The output should include the input character and use the plural form, n's, if the 
number of times the characters appears is not exactly 1.

Ex: If the input is:
n Monday

the output is:
1 n

Ex: If the input is:
z Today is Monday

the output is:
0 z's

Ex: If the input is:
n It's a sunny day

the output is:
2 n's

Case matters. n is different than N.

Ex: If the input is:
n Nobody

the output is:
0 n's


### TYPE YOUR CODE HERE

usr_input = input()
char_to_count = usr_input[0]
phrase = usr_input[2:]
count = phrase.count(char_to_count)

if count == 1:
    print(f"{count} {char_to_count}")
else:
    print(f"{count} {char_to_count}'s")
