Primary U.S. interstate highways are numbered 1-99. Odd numbers (like the 5 or 95) go north/south, and evens (like the 10 or 90) go 
east/west. Auxiliary highways are numbered 100-999, and service the primary highway indicated by the rightmost two digits. Thus, I-405 
services I-5, and I-290 services I-90. Note: 200 is not a valid auxiliary highway because 00 is not a valid primary highway number.

Given a highway number, indicate whether it is a primary or auxiliary highway. If auxiliary, indicate what primary highway it serves. Also 
indicate if the (primary) highway runs north/south or east/west.

Ex: If the input is:
90

the output is:
I-90 is primary, going east/west.

Ex: If the input is:
290

the output is:
I-290 is auxiliary, serving I-90, going east/west.

Ex: If the input is:
0

the output is:
0 is not a valid interstate highway number.

Ex: If the input is:
200

the output is:
200 is not a valid interstate highway number.


### TYPE YOUR CODE HERE

highway_number = int(input())

if highway_number % 100 <= 0:
    print(f'{highway_number} is not a valid interstate highway number.')
elif 1 <= highway_number <= 99:
    if highway_number % 2 == 0:
        print(f'I-{highway_number} is primary, going east/west.')
    else:
        print(f'I-{highway_number} is primary, going north/south.')
elif 100 <= highway_number <= 999:
    if highway_number % 2 == 0 :
        print(f'I-{highway_number} is auxiliary, serving I-{highway_number % 100}, going east/west.')
    else:
        print(f'I-{highway_number} is auxiliary, serving I-{highway_number % 100}, going north/south.')
