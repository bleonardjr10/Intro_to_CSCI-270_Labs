Write a program that takes in a positive integer as input, and outputs a string of 1's and 0's representing the integer in binary. 
For an integer x, the algorithm is:

As long as x is greater than 0
   Output x % 2 (remainder is either 0 or 1)
   x = x // 2

Note: The above algorithm outputs the 0's and 1's in reverse order. You will need to write a second function to reverse the string.

Ex: If the input is:
6

the output is:
110

The program must define and call the following two functions. Define a function named int_to_reverse_binary() that takes an 
integer as a parameter and returns a string of 1's and 0's representing the integer in binary (in reverse). Define a function 
named string_reverse() that takes an input string as a parameter and returns a string representing the input string in reverse.

def int_to_reverse_binary(integer_value)
def string_reverse(input_string)


### TYPE YOUR CODE HERE

def int_to_reverse_binary(int_value):
    binary_str = ''
    while int_value > 0:
        binary_str += str(int_value % 2)
        int_value = int_value // 2
    return binary_str

def string_reverse(input_string):
    return input_string[::-1]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    int_value = int(input())
    reversed_binary = int_to_reverse_binary(int_value)
    binary = string_reverse(reversed_binary)
    print(binary)
